The program, launched on November 30, 2021, aims to hone personal technical ability,
expand technical vision and improve programming ability. When I'm excited to write the
first line of code on this project, I'm sure I'll stick with it for a long time. I will
study these software technologies in this project:
1. Java
2. Framework
3. DevOps
4. Other programming languages like Golang and Python.
5. software engineering
...

Long may the code.
